[Link to the original problem on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

## Problem

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

### Example

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100

Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25

### Constraints

- -100.0 < x < 100.0
- -2^31 <= n <= 2^31-1
- n is an integer.
- -10^4 <= xn <= 10^4

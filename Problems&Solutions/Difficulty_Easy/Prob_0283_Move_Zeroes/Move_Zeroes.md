[Link to the original problem on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

## Problem

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

### Example

Input: 
nums = [0,1,0,3,12]

Output: 
[1,3,12,0,0]

Input: 
nums = [0]

Output: 
[0]

### Constraints

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

### Follow up
Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

# Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
[Link to the original problem on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

### Example

Input: 
root = `[1,null,2,3]`

Output: 
`[1,3,2]`

Input: 
root = `[]`

Output: 
`[]`

Input: 
root = `[1]`

Output: 
`[1]`

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

### Follow up
Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

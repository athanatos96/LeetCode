# Symmetric Tree

[Link to the original problem on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

### Example

Input: 
root = `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]`

Output: 
`true`

Input: 
root = `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]`

Output: 
`false`

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

### Follow up

Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

[Link to the original problem on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example

Input: 
root = `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`

Output: 
`3`

Input: 
root = `[1,null,2]`

Output: 
`2`

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

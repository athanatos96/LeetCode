[Link to the original problem on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

## Problem
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Example

Input: 
s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]

Output: 
["o","l","l","e","h"]

Input: 
s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]

Output: 
["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

### Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s[i] is a printable ascii character.

### Follow up

Can you solve it without using extra memory?

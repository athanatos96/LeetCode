[Link to the original problem on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

## Problem
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Example

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

### Constraints

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 * 104
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
